Java simple threading
=====================

This simple example defines two classes: SimpleThread and App. SimpleThread class is a subclass of the java.lang.Thread class. The App class provides a main() method that creates N (default N = 5) SimpleThread threads by a for loop.  After its construction, the main() method starts each thread by calling the start() method.
